# Background

This repository contains files for the project "Uncertainty is central for good inference".


## Data

## Scripts

- **folder: models** contains the stan models
- **folder: archive** contains the unused scripts
- **centrality_simulation.qmd** contains code to replicate the main simulation study
- **bmlvar_simulation.qmd** contains code to replicate the simulation study for the bmlVAR model. It mostly uses adapted code fom **centrality_simulation.qmd**
- **bmlvar_sparsity_simulation.qmd** contains code to compare different levels of sparsity in the bmlVAR model. 
- **simulated_example.qmd** contains code to build up a simulation study
- **functions.R** contains auxiliary functions
- **MLVAR_stan_recovery_checks.qmd** contains code to experiment with the mlVAR stan model on a single data set
- **empirical_example_rowland_wenzel_2020.qmd** Empirical Example: Rowland & Wenzel (2020
- **empirical_exmaple_bringmann_2016.qmd** Empirical Example: Bringmann et al. (2016)
- **mlvar_sim_experiments.qmd** contains code to experiment with mlVAR simulation 
- **05_simulation_viz.qmd** contains code to visualize the simulation results
